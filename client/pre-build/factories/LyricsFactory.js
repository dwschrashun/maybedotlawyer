	var lyrics = "the happy campers standing in their lines \ndelicious pastries with some wild designs\ni got up early just to see if i could smell something other than the stationary desperate perspiration\n\nthe kids are saving up their nickels and dimes\nfocusing in on all the smaller crimes\nbottling sweat from all the passers by\nselling it to china at exorbitant rates\n\ni wanna live\ni wanna be\nat this fantastic disco\n\naaaa\n\neverything you thought you’d never find\nin every color \nevery different kind\nis on somebody’s head right now\nfrom moscow or rome\nwho’s got the plastic\n\nnobody visibly losing their mind\nbut tons of stuff that you could hide behind\nmickey mouse grew up a zoning code\ngot bored to death by all the zeroes in his ledger\n\njimmy carter once ate here\na buffalo once ate here\nsandra day oconnor once ate here\nand shirley temple once ate here\nand i don’t know who this is but he once ate here\ngenghis khan is buried here\na bird once ate here\nwayne gretzky once at here\nbut guy fieri never bothered\n\nthe sticker says that they accept american express\nthis self righteous yelp review says that the service is top notch\nbut i’m unimpressed\n\nsilvio burlesconi once ate here\nspiking his pepsi with a flask of campari\nhe spat on the floor and he frightened a child\nand of course\nbefore leaving he groped a waitress\nsteffi graf once ate here\ndonald trump once ate here\ncher once ate here\ncher once ate here\nbut the people who live down the block never bothered\n\nthe sticker says that they accept american express\nthis yelp review is poorly written\nlet’s burn down the applebees\nlet’s burn down the shitty soup store\n\nthe sticker says that they accept american express\nthis whiskey list is poorly written\nlet’s take our business elsewhere\n\nmalcolm jamal warner once ate here\nkelsey grammar once ate here\nfour assholes from belgium at 3 in the morning once sat down and left without ordering anything\ndan brown ate here\nrichard ford ate here\njohn franzen ate here\nand dave eggers ate here\noprah once ate here\nand that was amazing\nbut no one who I ever knew ever bothered\n\ngazing down on choppy seas\nfrom gilded balconies\nthe bodies of our enemies\nlike buoys on the surf\n\ni once knew a man whose heart was virtuous and pure\nhe got what he deserved\n\nsafe, secure and well insured\nwe board the helicopter\nthe fbi lined up outside\nto autograph my dick\n\ngazing down on choppy seas\nfrom gilded balconies\nthe bodies of our enemies\nlike buoys on the surf\n\nin miami\ni’m a mailman\nin atlanta\ni’m in jail again\nin miami\ni’m a blowfish\nin atlanta\ni’m a sandwich\n\nand i never ever wanna go back there baby\n\ni’m riding a skateboard\non top of a speeding truck\ni jump through a stained glass window\nin the history museum\n\nin toledo\ni’m a black dress\nin granada\ni’m a total mess\nin toledo\ni’m a pool shark\nin granada\ni’m your pitch dark room\n\ni’m flying my jetpack on my way back\nfrom the mall\nno gas and\ni crash land\nin the presidential opera hall\n\nin the science center\nnear the neutron station\nwe’ve got laser lightning\nwe’ve got radiation\n\nthey’re gonna pour the liquid\ninto plastic cups\nyou’re gonna drink it down\nyou’re gonna throw it up\nthey’re making babies now\n\ni want it\n\ntake all our contraptions\nmake all our decisions\ndna extractions\ndreams are primordial visions\n\nin the science center\nnear the neutron station\nwe’ve got pyroplasma\nwe’ve got reservations\n\neverybody’s just standing up\nshrugging their shoulders\nclogging up the downtown\nlet’s give em something to talk about baby\nbuild a stadium where they can sit down\n\nexotic fishes next to the bathroom\nmoulded plastic chairs that fold up\nstrange feeling this all has gotta end soon\nworld record: most elegant coat pile\n\ntear the roof of the carpet store\nreconfigure the walls into a new shape\nput the windows on the ground and freeze it over\ninvite the chinese in\nwatch em ice skate\n\noh, but we forgot about the sight lines\nmy god what a disaster\nthey can’t say\ngrab that tv\nhold it above your head\na beacon guiding you home to your trash heap\n\nthere’s running water\nthere’s radiator heat\nthere’s dark mysterious figures with checkered pasts\nthere’s lemonade by the glass\nthere’s ibuprofen\nthere’s entertainment4everyone at last\n\nget illegal cable\nlock the dogs up in the yard and the zebras in the stable\nsnort some suntan lotion\nyou hold this shell up to your eye\ncuz i bet you’ll see the ocean\ngood doctor’s in a bad mood\nred lobster has such rad food\nsmoke salmon with some sad dudes\nthis concierge is fuckin mad rude\n\nthe surprise is we lied\nyeah we’re super guys\ngonna swallow some pills in the hills tonight\nschool supplies in the ride\nyeah we’re super guys\nstash the amyls inside my stupid jacket\n\nlearn how you can sell it\nhave you ever eaten ice cream out of mini baseball helmets\nso you’re a chainsaw operator\nare you for real enough to do designer drugs on the equator\nblood smears on the ceiling\nillegal cable isn’t free really\nthese pants are too revealing\ntell me party people can you hear me\n\nsee the lies in our eyes\nyeah we’re super guys\ni never showed up at rowing practice\nbig supplies\nbig surprise\nyeah, we’re super guys\nput the weapons inside my letter jacket\n\ni went to your website last week\neverybody said i should\ni clicked on a million pictures\ni don’t think i understood\nnothing there that i remember\ni couldn’t recognize your face\nwhen did you get so much taller\nyou’re just an empty space\n\ni’m not prepared for this\nis anyone aware of this\nthis is really scary\nthere’s a thing\ni don’t know where it is\nsomething about the words that you wrote\nthey don’t make sense to me\ndifferent body attached to your name and your past\nfar as i can see\n\ncontext clues\npress on tattoos\neverybody said that you were bad news\n\nfacial tics\nthe curve of the lip\nyour sweat\nyour high wire tricks\nthe trip wires trip\nyou let\nyou let your password slip into the wrong hands\nbut it’s not your fault\nyou wanna manufacture and bottle quicksand\nyou grind to a halt";
